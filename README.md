# exposedserver
Minecraft plugin that exposes important information to a websocket, which you can access from anywhere with just the IP address, port and API Key.

# Instructions
Add the release jar to your mods folder in Fabric 1.21.1. Do this at your own risk, as it may lead to another open port on your PC/Network. Use at your own risk on any server hosting service, or use their dashboard instead.

# Client access
Visit the client site at [placeholder]. Add your server IP and exposedserver port (8000 by default). Do not use the same port as your main server. Both ports must have port forwarding enabled. Press connect, and wait for the websocket to attach. Once done, your stats should update periodically.
